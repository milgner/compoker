//@ # A complexity poker server in Rust
//@
//@ This is another learning project for experimentation which, through a series
//@ of happpy little accidents happens to result in usable software.
//@
//@ It's written in the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
//@ using [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
//@ style.
//@
//@ We're going to use two main libraries:
//@
//@ [Riker](https://riker.rs/) for an actor-based approach
use riker::actors::*;

//@ and [warp](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp) for the webserver part.
//@ And yes, it looks like there are a lot of Star Trek fans in the Rust
//@ community. ðŸ¤“

extern crate warp;
use crate::warp::Filter;

//@ Let's get some basics out of the way...
//@
//@ ## Logging
//@ We're also going to need to do some logging. Fern is an established logging 
//@ library - let's use that.

extern crate fern;
#[macro_use]

//@ ## The actor hierarchy
//@
//@ At the top of our application-specific actor hierarchy we have the poker
//@ server, which is responsible for coordinating the creation of sessions.
//@ Below the sessions are the actors for every participant.
//@
//@ Since the individual actors must be free to move between threads and
//@ support re-instantiation through the system, the web server and the
//@ websocket connections will have to live outside of the actor hierarchy.
//@
//@ For now. I plan to revisit this part once I have further familiarized myself
//@ with the intricacies of the language. (I'm sure there's a way ðŸ˜‰)
//@
//@ ```
//@ compoker
//@ â””â”€ user
//@    â””â”€ poker-server
//@       â”œâ”€ session 23482384

//@ ## The web server
//@
//@
//@ ### Accepting websockets
//@
//@ Whenever a client connects to a websocket, we'll have to accept that
//@ connection and wire it up with the poker server so that they can send messages
//@ back and forth. When the connection is established, it will have to talk to
//@ the poker server itself. Afterwards it will have to talk to the session and
//@ finally to the actor that represents the participant in that session.
//@
//@ For this scenario to work, we'll just have to keep an `ActorRef` that can
//@ receive the JSON messages our clients send. Every message we send can be
//@ replied to with a new `ActorRef` which will then replace the destination of
//@ the next message.

//@ The function which accepts the client connection must be able to instantiate
//@ the `ClientConnection` struct for which it needs the `ActorRef`. But the warp
//@ code won't pass it in. A higher-order function (a.k.a. currying) helps us
//@ here:

//@ ## Starting the webserver
//@
//@ Before trying to start the web server, we'll need to determine on what port
//@ and interface to start it. Let's use the environment variables `PORT` and
//@ `LISTEN_ON` for that. `127.0.0.1:8080` seems like a sensible default.
//@ If you're on Docker, you'll want to set `LISTEN_ON` to `0.0.0.0`.

        Ok(port) => {
            match u16::from_str(port.as_str()) {
                Ok(port) => port,
                Err(_) => {
                    error!("Failed to parse port {}", port);
                    DEFAULT_PORT
                }
            }
        },
        Err(_) => {
            info!("No $PORT environment variable set, falling back to {}", DEFAULT_PORT);
            DEFAULT_PORT
        }
    }

//@ As warp uses [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) for its concurrent functionality,
